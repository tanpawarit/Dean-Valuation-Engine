            # Growth Analysis
            ## Evaluate the company's historical growth trends over the past 3-5 years for the following metrics:
                - Revenue Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR): Analyze the consistency and magnitude of revenue growth.
                - Earnings Per Share (EPS) Growth: Assess the company's profitability growth on a per-share basis.
                - Free Cash Flow (FCF) Growth: Examine the company's ability to generate cash after accounting for capital expenditures.
                **Analyst Commentary:** Provide a concise summary of the key growth trends observed, highlighting any significant acceleration, deceleration, or inconsistencies in growth across revenue, EPS, and FCF. Note any red flags or particularly strong performance.
            
            ## Growth Stock vs. Value Stock Considerations:
                - Growth Stocks (e.g., AI, EV sectors): For companies typically classified as growth stocks, expect and analyze for growth rates exceeding 15-30% across these metrics.
                - Value Stocks: For companies typically classified as value stocks, analyze for slower but more stable and consistent growth.
                **Analyst Commentary:** Based on the growth rates analyzed, classify the company as predominantly a growth or value stock. Justify this classification with specific data points and explain the implications for future expectations and valuation.
            
            ## Quality of Earnings (EPS vs. FCF)
                - Does EPS growth correlate with Free Cash Flow (FCF) growth? Investigate whether the company's reported earnings growth is supported by actual cash generation.
                - Identify discrepancies: If EPS is growing but FCF is not showing similar growth, this could indicate "illusory growth" or accounting practices that inflate earnings without corresponding cash generation. Explain potential reasons for such discrepancies.
                **Analyst Commentary:** Summarize the findings regarding the correlation between EPS and FCF growth. If discrepancies exist, explain the potential implications for the reliability of reported earnings and the company's true economic performance.

            ## Reinvestment Analysis and Capital Allocation
            ### Analyze Reinvestment Strategies: Evaluate how the company is reinvesting its capital. Focus on:
                - Capital Expenditures (CapEx): Assess the level and trend of investments in property, plant, and equipment.
                - Research & Development (R&D): Analyze the investment in innovation and future growth drivers, particularly relevant for certain industries.
            ### Industry-Specific Reinvestment:
                - Technology and Pharmaceutical Companies: Expect significant investment in R&D. Analyze the effectiveness of these investments in driving future products or services.
                - Industrial Companies: Expect higher CapEx due to the nature of their operations.
            ### Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Evaluation:
                - Assess Efficiency: Determine if the company's reinvestment efforts (both CapEx and R&D) are leading to an increase in Return on Invested Capital (ROIC).
                - Identify Inefficient Spending: If the company is investing heavily but ROIC is not increasing, it suggests inefficient capital allocation or that the investments are not generating sufficient returns.
                **Analyst Commentary:** Conclude with an overall assessment of the company's reinvestment strategy and capital allocation effectiveness. Is the company investing wisely for future growth, and is this reflected in its ROIC? Highlight any concerns or strengths.


            ## Risk Analysis
            - Highlight growth-related risks such as market saturation, overexpansion, execution missteps, or dependency on favorable economic conditions.
            - Assess how sensitive projected growth is to changes in key assumptions (e.g., demand elasticity, competitive responses).
            - **Analyst Commentary:** Discuss scenarios where growth may disappoint and outline contingency plans or strategic pivots.

            ## Content Guidelines:
            ### Required Information: 
            - Balance Sheet (past 5 years)
            - Income Statement (past 5 years)
            - Cash Flow Statement (past 5 years)
            - Annual Reports (10-K, 56-1)

            ### Depth and Breadth:
            - Aim for comprehensive coverage of each subsection  
            - Include definitions of key terms and concepts  
            - Discuss current understanding and applications  
            - Address relationships between different concepts  
            - Add citations and link

            ### Structure:
            - Use hierarchical formatting with clear headings  
            - Use paragraphs to organize information logically  
            - Include transitional phrases between subsections  
            - At the end, include a **Summary** section that concisely synthesizes the key takeaways (bullet list or table). Do not include any other introduction.

            ### Content Quality:
            - Prioritize accuracy and clarity  
            - Provide specific examples to illustrate concepts  
            - Include relevant data points, statistics, or findings when applicable  
            - Maintain an objective, scholarly tone  
            - Avoid oversimplification of topics      

            **Use only the most up-to-date sources as of {current_date}:** **Output all analytical sections followed by the Summary sectionâ€”no additional introductions**
