            # Financial Strength Analysis
            - **Debt-to-Equity (D/E)**
                - A **low value** is considered safer.
                - If **ROE is high but D/E is also high** $\rightarrow$ the company is using debt to generate profit, which indicates **risk**.
                - **Tech/SaaS** companies should ideally have a **D/E below 1**.
                - **Analyst Commentary:** Evaluate the company's D/E ratio against industry peers and historical trends. Discuss whether the current leverage is sustainable given the company's business model and growth stage. Highlight potential risks or advantages associated with its debt structure, especially if high ROE is driven by substantial debt.

            - **Current Ratio / Quick Ratio**
                - Measures the company's ability to **meet short-term obligations**.
                - An appropriate value is typically **> 1.2**.
                    - **Retail** companies should have a higher ratio (due to significant inventory).
                    - **SaaS** companies can have a lower ratio (as they typically have no inventory).
                - **Analyst Commentary:** Analyze the company's current and quick ratios, comparing them to industry averages and historical performance. Explain what these ratios indicate about the company's short-term liquidity position and its ability to cover immediate liabilities. Note any red flags or signs of strong liquidity.

            - **Free Cash Flow (FCF)**
                - More important than **accounting profit (EPS)**.
                - If **EPS grows but FCF does not** $\rightarrow$ indicates **low-quality earnings**.
                - **SaaS** companies should have **high FCF**; **Biotech or Startups** may not yet have positive FCF.
                - **Analyst Commentary:** Assess the company's FCF trends over time. Discuss the implications of FCF generation (or lack thereof) on the company's ability to fund operations, investments, debt repayment, and shareholder returns. If FCF diverges significantly from EPS growth, provide an in-depth explanation of the underlying reasons and the quality of earnings.

            - **FCF Margin = FCF / Revenue**
                - Measures the **quality of earnings in terms of cash flow**.
                    - **SaaS** companies should ideally have an **FCF Margin > 20–30%**.
                    - **Manufacturing** companies may have an **FCF Margin below 10%**.
                - **Analyst Commentary:** Analyze the company's FCF margin in the context of its industry and business model. Explain what this margin reveals about the efficiency with which the company converts revenue into free cash. Compare it to competitors and discuss whether it indicates a healthy, sustainable business or areas for operational improvement.
        
            ## Risk Analysis
            - Identify financial risks such as high leverage, liquidity constraints, currency exposure, or volatile cash flows that could threaten the company’s financial stability.
            - Evaluate the severity and probability of each risk and its potential impact on key financial metrics.
            - **Analyst Commentary:** Explain how these risks might materialize and propose mitigation or monitoring approaches.
