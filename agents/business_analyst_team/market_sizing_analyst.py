    # Market Sizing Analysis
    - **TAM (Total Addressable Market):** Describe the total market demand your company could serve if there were no constraints on reach or resources.

    - **SAM (Serviceable Available Market):** Define the portion of the TAM that your company can realistically serve today given its current capabilities and geographic reach.

    - **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):** State the share of the SAM that your company is currently capturing.

    if High SOM:
    - **Expansion Opportunities:** Identify adjacent customer segments or new geographies (e.g., international markets, verticals) you could pursue to grow share.
    - **Analyst Commentary:** Explain why these expansion moves make strategic sense and what resources or partnerships would be required.

    if Low SOM:
    - **Growth Potential:** Assess your competitive advantages (e.g., technology, pricing, brand) and latent market demand to project potential share gains.
    - **Analyst Commentary:** Discuss which levers (marketing, product features, distribution) will drive that growth.
