Uber Technologies, Inc. operates a diverse business model centered around a global platform that offers mobility (ride-hailing), delivery (Uber Eats), freight services, and other emerging verticals such as Uber Health and autonomous vehicle partnerships. This platform functions as a two-sided marketplace, connecting supply (drivers, couriers) with demand (riders, eaters, shippers), and is characterized by its on-demand service model accessible via mobile apps. Uber's business model is primarily B2C, though it includes B2B elements through Uber Freight and Uber for Business [1].

### Revenue Breakdown and Financial Strength

In 2024, Uber's revenue was primarily driven by its mobility segment, which accounted for approximately $25.1 billion or 57% of total revenue. The delivery segment contributed $13.7 billion (31%), while freight added $5.1 billion (12%). Other bets, including emerging services, were immaterial to total revenue [1]. Uber's financial health is closely tied to the performance of its ride-hailing segment, which remains its profit engine with higher margins compared to the delivery segment, which faces intense competition [1].

Uber's financial strength is reflected in its debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio, which stands at 0.43–0.51, indicating a conservative capital structure compared to industry peers. This is supported by strong free cash flow (FCF), which reached $2.3 billion in Q1 2025, with a trailing twelve-month (TTM) FCF of approximately $7.8 billion. Uber's FCF margin of 19.5%–20.15% is high for its sector, underscoring its operational efficiency and cash generation capabilities [2].

### Growth Opportunities and Financial Performance

Uber has demonstrated robust growth, with a revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 41.6% from 2020 to 2024. Earnings per share (EPS) turned positive in 2022 and grew significantly, although the 2024 EPS was inflated by a one-time tax benefit. Free cash flow has also transitioned from negative to strongly positive, reflecting sustainable cash generation [3].

Uber's growth potential is supported by its strategic focus on expanding into new geographies and verticals, such as grocery and pharmacy delivery, and scaling Uber Freight in Europe and Asia. The company's technology, brand recognition, and scale provide competitive advantages that can drive market share gains [1].

### Capital Allocation and Investment

Uber's capital expenditures remain low due to its asset-light model, while significant investments in research and development (R&D) continue to drive innovation. The return on invested capital (ROIC) improved dramatically from negative to nearly 20% in 2024, indicating that Uber's investments are generating strong returns [3].

### Conclusion

Uber is positioned as a growth stock with significant expansion opportunities in urban mobility, on-demand delivery, and digital logistics. Its financial strength, characterized by a conservative capital structure and strong cash flow generation, supports its strategic investments and growth initiatives. However, the company faces challenges such as regulatory risks and competitive pressures, particularly in the delivery segment. Investors should focus on Uber's free cash flow as a reliable indicator of its economic performance and sustainability.
