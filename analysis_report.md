## Comprehensive Analysis of JPMorgan Chase's TAM, SAM, and SOM

### Core Business Model
JPMorgan Chase operates as a universal bank, offering a wide range of financial services across consumer and community banking, corporate and investment banking, commercial banking, and asset & wealth management. This diversified model allows the bank to cross-sell products, manage risk effectively, and maintain resilience through economic cycles. The bank's scale and global reach create significant barriers to entry, although it faces risks from regulatory scrutiny and competition from fintechs and non-bank financial institutions.

### Revenue Breakdown and Consistency
The bank's revenue is well-diversified across its segments:
- **Consumer & Community Banking:** ~42% of total revenue
- **Corporate & Investment Bank:** ~33%
- **Asset & Wealth Management:** ~14%
- **Commercial Banking:** ~11%

This diversification supports margin stability and cushions against downturns in any single segment. The revenue mix includes both recurring income from loans and asset management fees and cyclical income from investment banking and trading activities.

### Market Sizing Analysis
